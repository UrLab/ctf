        <h2>Are you new to CTFs ?</h2>
        <p class="text-muted">
            If you already participated to CTFs, you may safely skip this part.
        </p>
        <p>
            CTFs are competitions where you try validate as much challenges as you can and as quickly as possible.
            The challenges will be very diverse :
            it can be cryptography were you have to break some encryption scheme, reverse engineering where you
            have to disassemble some binaries to understand how they work,
            steganography were you have to find hidden messages in files or other messages,
            websites were you have to access informations that you shouldn't be able to access,
            forensics where you have to find information back from memory dump or corrupted files and, finally,
            networking where you have to analyze network data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you'll gain access to the hidden information, you'll get a flag.
            It looks like a password most of the time and you'll need to give is to us (on the platform) to prove us that you validated the challenge.
            To resolve those challenges, we highly suggest you to have at least a UNIX virtual machine
            with some tools ready to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some nice tools to have are:
            <ul>
                <li>A good programming language that you know well
                (if you don't master one, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> might be interesting) </li>
                <li>A disassembler (like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/objdump">objdump</a>
                or <a href="https://radare.org/">radare2</a>) </li>
                <li>Some tools to get metadatas out of files</li>
                <li>Memory dumps analyzers (like <a href="http://www.volatilityfoundation.org/">volatility</a>) </li>
                <li>A library call tracer (<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ltrace">ltrace</a>)
                and a <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/">debugger</a></li>
                <li>A port scanner (<a href="https://nmap.org/">nmap</a>)</li>
                <li>And some knowledge but it will come with time and
                <a href="https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en">training</a> :) </li>
            </ul>
            Please don't use automated testing tools (like nikto, wapiti, sqlmap,...) or brute forcing tools unless specified in the challenge description because if everyone does it, nobody will be able to access the challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flags sharing is also forbidden and asking other to resolve your challenges too.
            Don't try neither to steal from or listen to other teams or to prevent them to access to the challenges or the platform by any means. Thank you for the understanding.<br>
            Oh, and don't try to hack the CTF platform, you would be disqualified...
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope that you are going to have a lot of fun!
