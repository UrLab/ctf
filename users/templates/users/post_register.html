            <p>To be able to compete and fully use this website, you first have to join or create a team.<br>
            Being in a team is mandatory to compete in the qualifications and the finale.</p>

                If you don't have any team mates, send us an email at <a href="mailto:ctf@urlab.be">ctf@urlab.be</a>
                and we will try to find you a team.
