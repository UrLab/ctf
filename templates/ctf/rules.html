        Rules
    </h1>

<p>
Here is a quick reminder of the rules:
<ul>
    <li>Do not tamper with the server or try to cheat (the server is monitored)</li>
    <li>Do not share flags with other teams</li>
    <li>Do not eavesdrop on other teams or intercept their communications</li>
    <li>Do not bruteforce the platform</li>
    <li>You must be a student to participate in the challenge</li>
    <li>You must be a student of ULB or VUB to participate in the finals (we will check your academic email).</li>
    <li>Some challenges might give you access to a shell or allow some remote code execution. It's forbidden to destroy or tamper with the challenge or the flag.</li>
    <li>Do not spoil challenges or flags in public or on IRC (use irc queries with the admins instead)</li>
</ul>

If you break any of these rules, you and your team will be permanently banned. You have been warned :)<br>
If you think you might break the rules but are not sure, feel free to contact us to clarify the situation!
</p>


The top 10 teams from the qualifiers will be invited to the finals to compete for first place and win awesome prizes.
